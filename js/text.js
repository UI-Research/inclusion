On average, cities that underwent recovery increased an average of 20 rankings on overall inclusion.","On average, improvements were greater than declines. For example, <a href = \"index.html?city=midland_TX\" target = \"_blank\">Midland, Texas</a>, had the second-largest increase in overall inclusion during its recovery, jumping 160 spots. On the other hand, <a href = \"index.html?city=north_las_vegas_NV\" target = \"blank\">North Las Vegas</a>, which lost the most ground, dropped only 132 spots.","Racial inclusion tended to improve more than economic inclusion during an economic recovery.
